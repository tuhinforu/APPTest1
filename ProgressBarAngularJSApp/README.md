# Angular_Template
Single-Page Angular Application

This single-page application is part of a series of full-stack applications that are aimed at helping students understand the nuances of partciular frontend frameworks. By building similar apps in different frameworks, I hope to highlight the similarities and differences that can be found within each framework.

#Starting the app

This app requires that the user has MongoDB and Node installed on their machines. Once these have been properly configured, simply run the npm install or yarn install commands.

#Starting the server

To start the server, simply run the npm start (or nodemon server.js if you have it installed)  in your terminal.
